# Go Web Server for Managing Books

This Go code sets up a simple web server for managing a collection of books. It provides endpoints to:

1. **Get all books**: Sends a JSON response containing details of all books in the collection.
2. **Add a new book**: Accepts a JSON payload representing a new book and adds it to the collection.
3. **Get a book by ID**: Retrieves the details of a specific book based on its ID.
4. **Checkout a book**: Decrements the quantity of a book by one, simulating a checkout process.

## Overview of Components

### Data Structure
- The code defines a `book` struct to represent the properties of a book.

### Main Functionality
1. **Finding a Book by ID**: 
   - `findBookByID` function iterates over the list of books to find a book with the provided ID.
   
2. **HTTP Handlers**:
   - `/books`: 
     - **GET**: Returns all books.
     - **POST**: Adds a new book.
   - `/books/{id}`: 
     - **GET**: Returns details of a book by ID.
   - `/checkout`: 
     - **PATCH**: Decrements the quantity of a book.

3. **Server Setup**:
   - A `http.NewServeMux()` is used to set up request multiplexing.
   - Listens for incoming requests on port `:8080`.

### Error Handling
- Proper error handling is implemented for various scenarios such as invalid requests, book not found, and internal server errors.

## Running the Server
- Run the server locally using `go run main.go`.
- Access the endpoints using tools like curl or Postman.

## Dependencies
- The code uses only the standard library packages provided by Go.
